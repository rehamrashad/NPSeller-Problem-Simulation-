# Newspaper Seller Profit Optimization

## Overview
The Newspaper Seller Profit Optimization project is a simulation program developed to help newspaper sellers maximize their profits by determining the optimal number of papers to purchase each day. By considering various factors such as demand probabilities, buying and selling prices, and scrap values, the program aims to identify the best purchasing strategy for the seller.

## Features
- Simulates the newspaper selling process over multiple days
- Considers demand probabilities for different types of newspapers (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Calculates revenue from sales, lost profit from excess demand, and salvage from scrap paper sales
- Identifies the optimal number of papers to purchase to maximize profit
- Provides insights into daily profit distributions through histograms

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PrettyTable
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with required dependencies (NumPy, PrettyTable, Matplotlib).
3. Run the program by executing the `newspaper_seller.py` file.
4. Input the number of days to simulate, number of trials, and the bundle size for purchasing newspapers.
5. View the program output, including the optimal purchasing strategy and profit distribution histograms.
